- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?

I decided to overload the constructors, because I thought that the defaults for both a library and cafe on Smith college should be Neilson and the Campus Center Cafe respectively. I also overloaded constructors for if the address and floor number of buildings was unknown. I also decided to overload the enter method in House because if you enter Jordan House from one of the doors, you will automatically be on your way to the second floor rather than the first. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I liked being able to overload constructors, because in the real world, especially if you're trying to use a map to get somewhere for the first time or navigate a building for the first time you might not necessarily know details about a building other than the name. I would recommend that students play around with these constructors!
